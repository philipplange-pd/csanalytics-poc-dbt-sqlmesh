# TBD:
 * liquid clustering (databricks features)  
   ðŸ’¡ could not find any hints (probably not supported - maybe custom_materialization)
 * GRANT permission on model  
   ðŸ’¡ cdp_inventory_reporting_demo.sql
 * merge (INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY)  
   ðŸ’¡ sdp_inventory_vehicles_preview_incremental_key
 * blue green deployment  
   ðŸ’¡ make changes and deploy to own "environment" (sqlmesh plan my_dev -> schema "test__my_dev" instead of "test")  
   ðŸ’¡ only executes actual changes (thanks to virtual layers)  
   ðŸ’¡ compare sqlmesh table_diff prod:my_dev test.cdp_inventory_reporting_demo  
 * orchestration (databricks workflows?)  
   ðŸ’¡ not possible  
   ðŸ’¡ dedicated resource necessary running "sqlmesh run"
 * multi repository support (orchestration)  
   ðŸ’¡ sqlmesh -p sqlmesh-a -p sqlmesh-b plan
 * monitoring  
   ðŸ’¡ central sqlmesh process which orchestrates everything  
   ðŸ’¡ how does monitoring on a product team level work?
 * postgres state backend
